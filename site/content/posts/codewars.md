<a href="https://www.codewars.com">Codewars</a> is a site that has code problems in all kinds of languages. All problems include a set of tests, so it's easy to check if you solved the problem. The best part is that once you've turned in your solution, you can look at the solutions of other people and perhaps learn a thing or two.
