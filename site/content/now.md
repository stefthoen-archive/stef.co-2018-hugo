# What I'm doing now

Last update was on **April 8 2018**. This page is inspired by [Nownownow](http://nownownow.com/).

I'm home in [Fr√©toy, France](https://goo.gl/maps/dSzSBm3K1Xp). 

Working as a freelance web developer on client projects. Right now on WordPress/WooCommerce website that takes a lot of custom work, so I've been building a lot of OO WordPress plugins, which has been fun but also a struggle.

Working on my JS chops: Try to write in a functional style. Working trough a [course](https://courses.knowthen.com/p/functional-programming-for-beginners-with-javascript) at the moment and looking to build small JS apps to solidy new knowledge.

Looking into functional CSS frameworks like [Tachyons](https://tachyons.io/) and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/). Will try it out for a coming project.

Working on this very website. I've ported it to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) a while ago, but there where a lot of bugs and I hadn't used Hugo's features at all. I'm slowly adding stuff to my website. Yesterday I've added a blog and today I'm writing this Now page. I think I like this idea of slowly making a website better instead of building a new one from scratch.

Doing some DIY projects around the house. There's a small house on our land that hasn't been lived in for 30 years. The roof is leaking and can collapse any minute. I'm going to build studs to support the roof and close up the holes.

Once my daughter's room is done, we'll move back to our own bedroom and will free up my future office. I'll close up the wall and build some custom cabinets. Maybe a door that runs on a rail, so I can close off the space if I need to get work done.
